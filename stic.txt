Here are a few suggestions related to some improvements:
-> slide 2: why not to use the numbered points? (the environment {enumerate} or at least {itemize} - it would look better than now)
-> slide 3 and others: it will be easier to comprehend for the audience when the long text is divided to bullet points; generally the text from slides 3-4 may be given in three or four slides
-> slide 12: a complex issue is presented, so that you can divide it even to 2-3 slides; please show (maybe with the blackboard example) how the multiplication mod polynomial works
-> slide 14 and others: the slide looks nicer if you put \vfill between the block and the figure
-> slide 15 and others: all the variables should be written with the mathematical mode, e.g. $n$, $b$; additionally I am not sure why the block is not vertically centered...
-> slide 17 and the others: too much text - first, it will not be well visible from the back of the classroom and second, the audience will not be able to read and comprehend so much (thus, divide to 2 slides)
-> some typos (please check the slides against them): "attacks(cont.)" ==> "attacks(cont.)"
-> a short summarizing slide at the end (but not equal to the agenda list would be useful
-> I think that adding some points for discussion and comments at the end would increase the interest of the audience and encourage them to interact

Please send me the improved version along with all the LaTeX files (tex, figures, etc.) on Monday morning (up to 10.00) latest.

It is possible that I will have a few remarks concerning the presentation after you give it (since some other issues may appear or be better visible). Then, I will send you them with comments of your classmates.

Best regards, Piotr Cho³da
