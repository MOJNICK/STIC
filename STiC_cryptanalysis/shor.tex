Compute $gcd(a, N)$. This may be done using the Euclidean algorithm.\\
If $gcd(a, N) \neq 1$, then this number is a nontrivial factor of N, so we are done.
Otherwise, use the period-finding subroutine (below) to find r, the period of the following function:\\
$f(x)=a^{x}{\bmod {N}}$
%i.e. the order {\displaystyle r} r of {\displaystyle a} a in {\displaystyle (\mathbb {Z} _{N})^{\times }} (\mathbb {Z} _{N})^{\times }, %which is the smallest positive integer r for which {\displaystyle f(x+r)=f(x)} f(x+r)=f(x), or {\displaystyle f(x+r)=a^{x+r}{\bmod {N}}%\equiv a^{x}{\bmod {N}}.} {\displaystyle f(x+r)=a^{x+r}{\bmod {N}}\equiv a^{x}{\bmod {N}}.}
%If r is odd, go back to step 1.
%If a r /2 {\displaystyle \equiv } \equiv  âˆ’1 (mod N), go back to step 1.
%gcd(ar/2 + 1, N) and gcd(ar/2 - 1, N) are both nontrivial factors of N. We are done.
